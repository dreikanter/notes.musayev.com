<p>Who&#39;s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? You lived before you met me?! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that&#39;s why I&#39;m transferring to business school!</p>

<p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Robot 1-X, save my friends! <strong>And Zoidberg!</strong> <em>I saw you with those two &quot;ladies of the evening&quot; at Elzars.</em> Explain that.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-did-you-make-me">How much did you make me?</h2>

<p>Moving along… You&#39;re going to do his laundry? You are the last hope of the universe. I could if you hadn&#39;t turned on the light and shut off my stereo.</p>

<ol>
<li>Actually, that&#39;s still true.</li>
<li>You guys aren&#39;t Santa! You&#39;re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?</li>
<li>Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="bender-being-god-isnt-easy-if-you-do-too-much-people-get-dependent-on-you-and-if-you-do-nothing-they-lose-hope-you-have-to-use-a-light-touch-like-a-safecracker-or-a-pickpocket">Bender, being God isn&#39;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</h3>

<p>Hey, whatcha watching? Okay, it&#39;s 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can&#39;t hold the charge and the reception isn&#39;t very… Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>

<ul>
<li>Oh, I don&#39;t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</li>
<li>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn&#39;t make sense.</li>
<li>Large bet on myself in round one.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the last time, I don&#39;t like lilacs! Your &#39;first&#39; wife was the one who liked lilacs! No! The cat shelter&#39;s on to me. Kids don&#39;t turn rotten just from watching TV. No argument here. OK, this has gotta stop. I&#39;m going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.</p>

<p>Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Take me to your leader! Large bet on myself in round one. You&#39;re going to do his laundry?</p>

<p>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn&#39;t rock. Professor, make a woman out of me. Are you crazy? I can&#39;t swallow that. It must be wonderful.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>brew update
asdf plugin update ruby
asdf <span class="nb">install </span>ruby 3.2.2
</code></pre></div>
<p>Negative, bossy meat creature! And remember, don&#39;t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don&#39;t not do it! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book &#39;Earth in the Balance&#39;&#39;, and the much more popular &#39;&#39;Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth&#39;, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a popular name today. Little &quot;e&quot;, big &quot;B&quot;? I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! It&#39;s toe-tappingly tragic! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>

<p>Is that a cooking show? A sexy mistake. Morbo can&#39;t understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that&#39;s shaped like a man wearing a hat. Hey! I&#39;m a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</p>

<p>Too much work. Let&#39;s burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. And I&#39;m his friend Jesus. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. Can we have Bender Burgers again?</p>

<p>If rubbin&#39; frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don&#39;t wanna be right. No, I&#39;m Santa Claus! Say what? Can I use the gun?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? It doesn&#39;t look so shiny to me. What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Ok, we&#39;ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we&#39;ll go ride the bumper cars.</p>

<p>In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. Kif might! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</p>

<p>And until then, I can never die? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! You, a bobsleder!? That I&#39;d like to see! With gusto. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I&#39;ll rest easier not knowing where they are.</p>
